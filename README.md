User Story 

AS a freelance web developer 
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects 
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer 

Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input 
WHEN I am prompted for text 
THEN I can enter up to three characters 
WHEN I am prompted for the text color 
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number) 
WHEN I am prompted for a shape 
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square 
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color 
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number) 
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts 
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` 
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line 
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser 
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
